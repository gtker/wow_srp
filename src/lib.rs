//! An implementation of the World of Warcraft flavor of SRP6 used for authentication with the Login Server.
//! This should work on all versions from 1.2 to 3.3.5.
//!
//! The implementation is intended to abstract away as much of the protocol as possible,
//! and limits itself to the specific requirements of the World of Warcraft implementation.
//! For example, all key sizes are limited to exactly [32 bytes](LARGE_SAFE_PRIME_LENGTH) since
//! the network packet fields describing public keys are of a fixed size in the protocol
//! and key sizes of any other sizes are not possible.
//!
//! This crate does not deal with parsing the network packets necessary to obtain the required parameters.
//! The [`WoWDev` wiki](https://wowdev.wiki/Login_Packet) ([archive]) contains a reference list of packets
//! and the examples implement the required functionality.
//!
//! **THIS SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN WORLD OF WARCRAFT EMULATION.
//! THE CODE IS NOT CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY VERIFIED, HAS VERY LOW KEY SIZES BECAUSE OF
//! PACKET REQUIREMENTS AND MOST LIKELY CONTAINS EXPLOITS.**
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The crate is split into:
//! * A [`server`] module containing structs for use on the server.
//! Either `srp-fast-math` or `srp-default-math` must be enabled to for this to be enabled.
//! * A [`client`] module containing structs for use on the client.
//! Either `srp-fast-math` or `srp-default-math` must be enabled to for this to be enabled.
//! * A [`vanilla_header`] module containing structs for decrypting Vanilla world packets.
//! * A [`tbc_header`] module containing structs for decrypting TBC world packets.
//! * A [`wrath_header`] module containing structs for decrypting Wrath world packets.
//! `wrath-header` must be enabled for this to be enabled.
//! * An [`error`] module for errors that are shared by all modules.
//! * A [`normalized_string`] module used for all modules to correctly handle strings.
//!
//! ## Examples and Tests
//!
//! The [`wow_messages`](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages) repo has examples that uses the
//! [`wow_login_messages`](https://docs.rs/wow_login_messages/latest/wow_login_messages/)
//! and `wow_world_messages` library message definitions to showcase both crates.
//!
//! These can also be used for testing that the crate works with real clients.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! wow_srp = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["srp-default-math", "tbc-header", "wrath-header"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Then go to either the [`client`] module or [`server`] module for specific instructions.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! Two different arbitrary precision integer libraries can be used, either:
//!
//! * [num-bigint](https://crates.io/crates/num-bigint). A slow pure Rust implementation without
//! external dependencies. It is enabled through the `srp-default-math` feature.
//! This is enabled by default, and requires no opt in.
//!
//! * [rug](https://crates.io/crates/rug). A fast wrapper around the [GMP library](https://gmplib.org/)
//! with external dependencies, as described in the [`gmp_mpfr_sys` documentation](https://docs.rs/gmp-mpfr-sys/1.4.6/gmp_mpfr_sys/index.html#building-on-gnulinux).
//! This is enabled with the `srp-fast-math` feature and disabling default features.
//! So **instead** of the above do this:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! wow_srp = { version = "0.7.0", default-features = false, features = ["srp-fast-math", "tbc-header", "wrath-header"] }
//! ```
//!
//! The `srp-fast-math` feature leads to a 50% decrease in total time. It is highly recommended to enable
//! this feature for production usage since it also theoretically has better security.
//!
//! To see the performance difference on your setup you can run `cargo bench` for the default version,
//! and `cargo bench --features srp-fast-math --no-default-features` for the `srp-fast-math` version.
//!
//! The `wrath-header` feature gates features and dependencies related to [`wrath_header`].
//! The `tbc-header` feature gates features and dependencies related to [`tbc_header`].
//!
//! # MSRV
//!
//! `wow_srp` has a Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of 1.57.0.
//! The MSRV may be increased in `PATCH` versions before `wow_srp` reaches `1.0.0` (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
//!
//! # Other implementations
//!
//! * [Ember](https://github.com/EmberEmu/Ember/tree/development/src/libs/srp6) is a C++ implementation for 1.12 with a clean, tested implementation of the protocol.
//! * [`ArcEmu`](https://github.com/arcemu/arcemu/blob/00355000cac5d0b9bce42bf6d03d4aeda9e396ea/src/logon/Auth/AuthSocket.cpp#L74) is a C++ implementation for 3.3.5.
//! * [vMangos](https://github.com/vmangos/core/blob/fa9351de7e832510309209351c17f5c53f3155ef/src/realmd/AuthSocket.cpp#L350) is a C++ implementation.
//! * [`WoWCore`](https://github.com/RomanRom2/WoWCore/blob/92b7646c2bafb22ad6dca0acc9496a35561292c4/05875_1.12.1/pas/sandbox/AuthServer.pas#L133) is a Pascal implementation that has 1.12, 2.4.3 and 3.3.5 versions.
//! * [Shadowburn](https://gitlab.com/shadowburn/shadowburn/-/blob/ac905fabf56579b3bda6f16689c74f544da043e2/apps/common/lib/accounts/accounts.ex#L88) is an Elixir implementation.
